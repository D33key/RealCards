# RealCards - store

Real Cards is a sample application built to demonstrate my ReactJS skills.

## Features

1. To store the data I used:
    - [Mockapi.io](https://mockapi.io/) - Cart and Favorites data,
    - [JSONBin](https://jsonbin.io) - Product data
    - and also localStorage - Order data.
2. This project was set with `create-react-app`

## WebSite link

So here is the link to the website [Real Cards]().

## To-Do list

-   [ ] Add pages for each product
-   [ ] Add more product => make pagination
-   [ ] Fix bag if price will be more than 100k
